I am a first year PhD student studying [Computer Science at Princeton University](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/) in the [Princeton NLP Group](https://nlp.cs.princeton.edu/). Prior to Princeton, I was an ML/NLP researcher at [ASAPP](https://www.asapp.com/platform/applied-research/) and research assistant at Cornell NYC Tech. I recieved my M.Eng. from Cornell University and B.S. from National Taiwan University.

My research focuses on machine learning and its applications in natural language processing. I aim to design systems that understand natural language in an interpretable and robust way. I'm also interested in the intersection of areas such as knowledge representation, language acquisition through interaction, and reasoning in grounded environment.
