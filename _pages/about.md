I am a first year PhD student studying [Computer Science at Princeton University](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/) in the [PNLP Group](https://nlp.cs.princeton.edu/). Prior to Princeton, I was an ML/NLP researcher at [ASAPP](https://www.asapp.com/platform/applied-research/) and research assistant at Cornell NYC Tech. I recieved my M.Eng. from Cornell University and B.S. from National Taiwan University.

My research focuses on machine learning and its applications in natural language processing. I aim to design systems that understand natural language in a way that makes sense to humans. To do that, I'm interested in areas such as knowledge representation and reasoning, interpretability and robustness, language grounding, notion of causality in text, and methods insipred by cognative science.
