I am a fourth year PhD student researching ML/NLP in the [Princeton NLP Group](https://nlp.cs.princeton.edu/) and the [Princeton Language + Intelligence center](https://pli.princeton.edu/), co-advised by Professor [Danqi Chen](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~danqic/) and Professor [Karthik Narasimhan](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~karthikn/). Prior to Princeton, I was an ML/NLP researcher at [ASAPP](https://www.asapp.com/platform/applied-research/) and research assistant at Cornell NYC Tech. I recieved my M.Eng. from Cornell University and B.S. from National Taiwan University.

My research goal is to build intelligent systems (LLMs, language agents, etc) that are controllable, understandable, and can operate on a long interactive horizon.
Specifically, I am interested in how the different aspects of machine memory play a role in these contexts.
I have also worked on multi-modal grounded problems (e.g., language guided street view navigation).
