I am a first year PhD student studying [Computer Science at Princeton University](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/) in the [Princeton NLP Group](https://nlp.cs.princeton.edu/). Prior to Princeton, I was an ML/NLP researcher at <span style="color:#5DADE2">[ASAPP](https://www.asapp.com/platform/applied-research/)</span> and research assistant at Cornell NYC Tech. I recieved a B.S. from National Taiwan University and M.Eng. from Cornell University.

My research focuses on machine learning and its applications in natural language processing. I aim to design systems to understand natural language in an interpretable and robust way. Specifically, I focus on the intersection of areas such as knowledge representation, language acquisition through interaction, and reasoning in grounded environment. To achieve this, I'm interested in drawing upon ideas and techniques from relevant fields such as reinforcement learning, causal inference, and methods insipred by subfields in psychology.
