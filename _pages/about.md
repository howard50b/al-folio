I am a fourth year PhD student in the [Princeton NLP Group](https://nlp.cs.princeton.edu/) and the [Princeton Language + Intelligence center](https://pli.princeton.edu/), co-advised by Professor [Danqi Chen](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~danqic/) and Professor [Karthik Narasimhan](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~karthikn/).
My research goal is to build intelligent systems (e.g., LLMs, language agents, multi-modal models) that are controllable, robust, and can operate on a long interactive horizon.
I am particularly interested in how memory plays a role mechanistically in these contexts.

Prior to Princeton, I was a researcher at [ASAPP](https://www.asapp.com/) and research assistant at Cornell NYC Tech. I recieved my M.Eng. from Cornell University and B.S. from National Taiwan University.

Please see [my google scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wsNa_W4AAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=3) for the up-to-date publications.
