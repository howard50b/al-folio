I am a fourth year PhD student researching ML/NLP in the [Princeton NLP Group](https://nlp.cs.princeton.edu/) and the [Princeton Language + Intelligence center](https://pli.princeton.edu/), co-advised by Professor [Danqi Chen](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~danqic/) and Professor [Karthik Narasimhan](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~karthikn/). Prior to Princeton, I was an ML/NLP researcher at [ASAPP](https://www.asapp.com/platform/applied-research/) and research assistant at Cornell NYC Tech. I recieved my M.Eng. from Cornell University and B.S. from National Taiwan University.

My research focuses on machine learning and natural language processing.
My goal is to build systems (LLMs, language agents, etc) that are controllable, understandable, and can operate on a long interactive horizon.
Specifically, I am interested in how the different aspects of machine memory play a role under these contexts.
I have also worked in the vision + language domain (language guided street view navigation) in the past.
