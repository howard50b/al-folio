I am a PhD student studying [Computer Science at Princeton University](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/) in the [PNLP Group](https://nlp.cs.princeton.edu/) co-advised by Professor [Danqi Chen](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~danqic/) and Professor [Karthik Narasimhan](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~karthikn/). Prior to Princeton, I was an ML/NLP researcher at [ASAPP](https://www.asapp.com/platform/applied-research/) and research assistant at Cornell NYC Tech. I recieved my M.Eng. from Cornell University and B.S. from National Taiwan University.

My research focuses on machine learning and its applications in natural language processing. I aim to design NLP systems that are controllable, understandable, and robust. To do that, I'm interested in areas such as interpretability and robustness, controlled generation, and language grounding.
